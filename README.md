<h1 align="center">PanicLab Helper Core</h1>

This repository is a helper to calculate the proper result for the game [PanicLab](http://en.gigamic.com/game/panic-lab) by @Gigamic.
**It is just the core, which is not executable on its own!**

Repositories to actually use this helper will be added later on, such as an actual UI frontend or a CLI helper.
*I do neither own the game `PanicLab` nor the trademark `Gigamic`.
All rights belong to their respective owners.*

## Installation

If you still wish to use this repository, require it using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

composer require --dev paddys/panic-lab-helper-core
```
